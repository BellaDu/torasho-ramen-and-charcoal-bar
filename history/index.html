            Torasho Ramen and Charcoal Bar, the brainchild of restaurateur Tora
            Widjaja and Head Chef Sho Naganuma, introduces a modern Japanese
            Izakaya concept to the Tras Street gourmet enclave in the heart of
            Tanjong Pagar. After opening two successful restaurants in Jakarta,
            Tora sets his eyes on Singapore with the introduction of Torasho. To
            help launch the vision of Torasho, the restaurateur enlisted the
            expertise of Chef Sho, former Executive Chef at Hide Yamamoto at
            Marina Bay Sands who brings with him a wealth of Japanese
            gastronomic experience and a rabid following of eager diners.
          </p>
          <p class="t">
            In a deluge of Japanese Izakaya style restaurants in Singapore,
            Torasho raises the bar with its strong Southeast Asian inspired take
            on classic Japanese fare and effortlessly cool decor. The restaurant
            is conceptualised as a modern izakaya-style diner complete with open
            kitchen and a relaxed ambience with slick cement screed flooring and
            industrial style accents. There is also a stunning amount of detail
            paid to the kitchen which is outfitted with a custom elevator
            charcoal grill that allows the operator to control the intensity of
            the flame; it is evident that a lot of time, passion and thought has
            been put into the restaurant.

              >Torasho’s generous operating hours enables it to cater to
              everyone from lunch to late night supper crowds, offering hearty
              comfort food in a stylish vibrant environment; it is quite
              possibly the epitome of a hip-modern Japanese restaurant-bar. The
              curated repertoire of creative bites are inspired by the
              sophisticated Singaporean palate, with an extensive menu spanning
              appetisers, ramen and robata (grilled items). The food is best
              paired with Torasho’s expansive selection of drinks replete with
              sake, shochu, and creatively crafted whisky cocktails. If you are
              a sake lover, be sure to try Torasho’s very own branded
              sake.</span
